# Recipe App

This is a Django-based Recipe application that allows users to create and manage recipes with ingredients, cooking time, and descriptions. The application uses Django models and the Django admin panel to store and manage recipe data. This project was built as part of a learning exercise to practice database modeling, relationships, and testing in Django.
